# Multi-agent scenario with decentralized planning
This package is developed for decentralized path planning on a grid map for multiple agents.
The shorthest path is found by Dijkstra's algorithm.

The libraries are implemented in C++ 11.

The only dependency of this framework is [ROS](http://www.ros.org/install/).
